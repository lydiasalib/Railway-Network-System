Railway Network System – Graph-Based Pathfinding in Haskell (Spring 2025)
Designed and implemented a railway network simulation using Haskell, modeling stations as nodes and railways as weighted directed edges in an adjacency matrix. Applied Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path between any two stations using custom-built data structures including a recursive priority queue. Enabled dynamic graph updates and edge re-weighting through modular functions to simulate real-time route changes.
